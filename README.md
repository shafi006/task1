# task1
Write a program to encrypt and decrypt message using The One Time Pad method
This program takes a plaintext message and a key as input, and outputs the encrypted ciphertext and the decrypted plaintext. Note that this implementation uses addition and modulo operations instead of XOR to encrypt and decrypt the message. The key must be as long as or longer than the plaintext.
